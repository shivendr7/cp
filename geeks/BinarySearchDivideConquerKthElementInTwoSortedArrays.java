Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. 
The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The 5th element of this array is 6.
Example 2:
Input:
arr1[] = {100, 112, 256, 349, 770}
arr2[] = {72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892}
k = 7
Output:
256
Explanation:
Final sorted array is - 72, 86, 100, 112,
113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892
7th element of this array is 256.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthElement() which takes the arrays arr1[], arr2[], its size N and M respectively and an integer K as inputs and returns the element at the Kth position.

Given three integers M, N and K. Consider a grid of M * N, where mat[i][j] = i * j (1 based index). The task is to return the Kth smallest element in the M * N multiplication table.
 

Example 1:

Input:
M = 3, N = 3
K = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: 

The 5th smallest element is 6. 


Example 2:

Input:
M = 2, N = 3
K = 6
Output: 6 

 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function KthSmallest() which takes three integers as input and returns an integer as output.

Expected Time Complexity: O(M * log(M * N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= M, N <= 3 * 104
1 <= K <= M * N
