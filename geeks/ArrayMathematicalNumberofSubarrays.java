/*
Given an array of positive integers of size N, form groups of two or three such that the sum of all elements in a group is a multiple of 3. Count all possible number of groups that can be generated in this way.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {3, 6, 7, 2, 9}
Output: 8
Explanation: 
Groups of two are: 
{3, 6}, {3, 9}, {9, 6}, {7, 2}.
Groups of three are: 
{3, 7, 2}, {7, 2, 6}, {7, 2, 9}, {3, 6, 9}.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 4}
Output: 4
Explanation: Groups are {2,1}, {2,4}, 
{2,1,3}, {2,4,3}

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findgroups() which takes arr[] and n as input parameters and returns the number of possible groups.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ arri ≤ 106
